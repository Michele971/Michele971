## Main Projects

### [Predictive analysis for anomaly detection on bridges infrastructures](https://gitlab.com/BonnyBay/bridges-sensors)

We present a study where the aim is to find anomalies with a data-driven approach, using supervised techniques such as Neural Networks (feed-forward), SVM, Naive Bayes, KNN and Random Forest.
We developed binary and multiclass classification.


### [Algorand: social network analysis](https://gitlab.com/BonnyBay/snaproject)

Study of the Algorand blockchain network considering two periods of time: the All-Time High reached in December 2021 and the most important crash, in January 2022.
